# NetworkFlow-Visualization
This repository contains a mini project visualizing the Push-Relabel algorithm and Ford-Fulkerson  algorithm for network flow.
There are 7 text files and 2 zip files.
The two zip files graph1 and graph2 contains images for visualizing Ford-Fulkerson and Push-Relabel algorithm respectively.
The text files algo and algo2 are used for visualizing the algorithm, using a user level thread.
FF and PR files handles the frames of the algorithms.
Menu file explains the overall network flow problem and is the starting point of the project.
The files PushRelabel and FordFulkerson are the implementations of the respective algorithms in java, for a pre-defined graph and can be extended
to take input from the user.
Note: Set the path of the directory in which the images are extracted as the path of images in files algo and algo2.
Thank You.
